# Motion Based Smart Light System

This is a smart lighting system built using Arduino and a PIR motion sensor. It automatically turns the light on when motion is detected and off when there's no movement, improving energy efficiency.

# Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED
- TinkerCAD (for simulation)
- Arduino IDE

# Files
- iot_presentation.pptx â€“ Project presentation 

# How It Works
1. PIR sensor detects motion.
2. Arduino receives the signal.
3. LED turns on/off accordingly.
